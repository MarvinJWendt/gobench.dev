# Package Management

- Always use **pnpm** for installing and managing dependencies.
- Do not use `npm` or `yarn`.
- If you see `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`, warn the user and suggest removing them in favor of `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Commands
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Add dependency: `pnpm add <package>`
- Add dev dependency: `pnpm add -D <package>`
- Run scripts: `pnpm run <script>`
