name: Type Assertions
headline: Comparing type assertion, type switch, reflection, and comma-ok checks on interfaces.
description: >
  Compares four ways to check or extract the concrete type behind an interface value:
  direct type assertion (`v.(Type)`), a type switch (`switch v.(type)`),
  reflection via `reflect.TypeOf`, and the safe comma-ok assertion (`v, ok := v.(Type)`).
  These patterns appear frequently in generic code and interface-heavy designs,
  and their performance trade-offs are worth understanding.

  - implementation: Type Assertion
    description: >
      Direct type assertion using `v.(Type)`. The fastest form but panics
      if the interface value does not hold the expected type.

  - implementation: Type Switch
    description: >
      Type switch using `switch v.(type)`. Allows matching against multiple
      concrete types in a single construct with pattern-matching semantics.

  - implementation: Reflection Type Of
    description: >
      Reflection-based check using `reflect.TypeOf`. Most flexible but carries
      the overhead of the reflect package. The target type is cached before the
      hot loop.

  - implementation: Type Assertion With Ok
    description: >
      Comma-ok type assertion using `v, ok := v.(Type)`. Safe alternative to
      a bare assertion — returns false instead of panicking on mismatch.
