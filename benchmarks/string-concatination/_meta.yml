name: String Concatination
headline: Comparing string concatenation approaches in Go — from the naive + operator to strings.Builder and beyond.
description: >
  Compares four common ways to build a string incrementally in Go.
  Each implementation appends the same character repeatedly, letting
  the final string grow over time to expose performance differences.
  The `write` behavior measures the cost of appending, while `read`
  measures the cost of materializing the final string.

  - implementation: Append To Slice And Join
    description: >
      Appends strings to a slice with `append`, then calls `strings.Join`
      to produce the final result. Write is cheap (slice append), but read
      iterates and allocates the joined string.

  - implementation: Buffer
    description: >
      Uses `bytes.Buffer` to accumulate strings. Write is amortized O(1).
      Reading calls `buf.String()`, which copies the internal buffer into
      a new string (allocates).

  - implementation: Simple Append
    description: >
      Uses the `+` operator to concatenate strings. Each append copies
      the entire string, making the total cost O(n²). Reading is free
      since the result is already a string.

  - implementation: String Builder
    description: >
      Uses `strings.Builder` to accumulate strings. Write is amortized O(1).
      Reading calls `builder.String()`, which uses an unsafe conversion and
      does not allocate.
