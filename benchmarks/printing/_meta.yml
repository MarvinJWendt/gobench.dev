headline: Comparing the performance of different fmt printing functions in Go.
description: >
  The Go fmt package provides several functions for printing output.
  This benchmark compares Print, Println, and Printf (which write to stdout)
  against their Fprint, Fprintln, and Fprintf counterparts (which write to
  an io.Writer, here io.Discard). The Fprint variants avoid the overhead
  of going through os.Stdout, making them noticeably faster.
